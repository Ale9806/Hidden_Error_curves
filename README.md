# Hidden_Error_curves
An easy way to tune the number of layers and units in a neural network architecture 
When training Neural Networks one of the most difficult hyperparameters to trained ( based on my experience ) 
are the number of hidden units and layer. In order to easly solved this problem I make the following proposal (really basic one)
In order to visualize how our neural Network performs based on layers and number of units. Feel free to contact me if
you wish to know more about Hidden_error_curves
