# Hidden Error curves
An easy way to tune the number of layers and units in a neural network architecture 
When training Neural Networks one of the most difficult hyperparameters to trained ( based on my experience ) 
are the number of hidden units and layer. In order to easly solved this problem I make the following proposal (really basic one)
In order to visualize how our neural Network performs based on layers and number of units.
